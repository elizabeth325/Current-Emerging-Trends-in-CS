# Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS


-Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    At the beginning of this project, I was provided with most of the code. This included all of the necessary code for the program to run with the exception of the Q-Training Algorithm section. That section was laid out with comments to guide me towards the answers, but I completed the code myself. This was an essential piece of the program because it directs the agent on how to go about solving the maze.

-Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
    -What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
      Computer Scientists develop and maintain technology in order to solve problems. This means that they are on the front lines of tackling new issues in the world. In this course we learned about machine learning which is one of the ways that today's computer scientists are trying to solve new problems.
      
    -How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
      As a computer scientist I approached problems by trying to break them down into smaller chunks. If I can figure out what the small aspects of a larger problem are, then I can write code to address each one of those aspects. Eventually, this should result in a fully resolved issue.
      
    -What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
      As a computer scientist, I have an ethical responsibility not to violate the rights of the end user in any way. This means not stealing from them or using them or their information for nefarious purpouses. I also have a responsability to the organization to do the job which I have agreed to do. If I am collecting a paycheck to do a job, then to not do that job would be theft.
